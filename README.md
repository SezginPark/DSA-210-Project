# DSA-210-Project

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze how game updates and discount events influence the player count in both the short term and long term by analyzing user count data from steamcharts and discount and updates from individual game pages. This study will explore the patterns of player engagement before, during, and after major updates and discounts.

The aim of this project is whether updates and discounts can make lasting player growth or their impacts are temporary. This research will help in understanding how game developers can optimize their content strategies and pricing models to maximize player retention.

# Objectives 

- Analyze Short-Term vs. Long-Term Player Growth:
->Measure the immediate and long-term impact of updates and discounts on player numbers.

-  Evaluate Discount Effectiveness:
->Compare player count trends before and after discount periods.
->Identify if player retention increases or if numbers drop after the discount ends.

- Assess Update Impact: 
->Determine whether new content, patches, or expansions significantly boost player engagement.
->Analyze whether major updates have a stronger effect than minor balance patches.

- Compare Different Games & Genres: 
->Identify which types of games benefit the most from updates and discounts.
->Compare free-to-play vs. paid games in terms of player retention after events.

- Examine Seasonal Trends & External Factors:
->Identify whether certain months (e.g., holiday seasons) amplify the effect of discounts and updates.
->Analyze if certain pricing strategies are more effective depending on the time of year.
